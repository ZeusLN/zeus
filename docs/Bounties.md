## Core Lightning: Commando/lnmessage connection

Payout: 3,000,000 sats (0.03 BTC)

Currently, ZEUS supports remote connections to Core Lightning (CLN) through c-lightning-REST. We'd like for users to connect to CLN nodes using the [Commando](https://lightning.readthedocs.io/lightning-commando.7.html) and [lnmessage](https://github.com/aaronbarnardsound/lnmessage). We've made some pretty good progress on [this branch](https://github.com/ZeusLN/zeus/compare/master...kaloudis:zeus:lnsocket) that you can use but we are having issues getting the socket to work. lnmessage has params for `socket` and `tcpSocket` that you should be able to configure and override.

## SATSCARD support

Payout: 5,000,000 sats (0.05 BTC)

We would like to add support for the SATSCARD NFC smartcard in ZEUS. Users should be able to initialize cards, check balances, shuffle through addresses, ,generate QR codes of addresses from cards, and sweep balances. SATSCARD should have its own dedicated view in the app to manage the cards. Bonus points if you expose the TapSigner endpoints for a future integration down the line.

[This library](https://github.com/schjonhaug/tapcards) may prove helpful in the integration.

## Point of Sale: Clover integration

Payout: 1,500,000 sats (0.015 BTC)

Currently, the ZEUS point of sale only works in tandem with the Square terminal API. We would like to expand support to Clover terminals. Check out the docs for the [Clover REST API](https://docs.clover.com/docs/making-rest-api-calls).

# Claimed Bounties

## Eclair support
Author: [fiatjaf](https://github.com/fiatjaf)

[Pull Request](https://github.com/ZeusLN/zeus/pull/323)

Payout: 1,500,000 sats (0.015 BTC)

Currently, ZEUS supports remote connections to lnd, c-lightning (through c-lightning-REST and Spark), and lndhub. We'd like for users to connect to Eclair nodes using the [Eclair REST interface](https://acinq.github.io/eclair/).

## Tor on Android
Author: [gabidi](https://github.com/gabidi/) and [Sifir Apps](https://sifir.io/)

[Pull Request](https://github.com/ZeusLN/zeus/pull/394)

Payout: 21,000,000 sats (0.21 BTC)

Currently, ZEUS on Android requires Orbot to connect to your node over the Tor network. We'd like for users to be able to connect to their node over Tor without the use of Orbot, similar to Samourai Wallet. The user should be able to start and stop the Tor process and get a new identity if possible.

## Tor on iOS
Author: [gabidi](https://github.com/gabidi/) and [Sifir Apps](https://sifir.io/)

[Pull Request](https://github.com/ZeusLN/zeus/pull/394)

Payout: 22,050,000 sats (0.2205 BTC)

Currently, ZEUS on iOS cannot connect over Tor. Users looking to connect remotely need a VPN configuration. We'd like for users to be able to connect their node over Tor without the use of another app. The user should be able to start and stop the Tor process and get a new identity if possible.

## lnurl-channel
Author: [pseudozach](https://github.com/pseudozach)

[Pull Request](https://github.com/ZeusLN/zeus/pull/478)

Payout: 500,000 sats (0.005 BTC)

lnurl-channel allows users to have a channel opened to them by scanning a QR code. Some services let you turn a balance into a channel in this manner. Check out the spec [here](https://github.com/fiatjaf/lnurl-rfc/blob/master/lnurl-channel.md).

## lnurl-auth
Author: [pseudozach](https://github.com/pseudozach)

[Pull Request](https://github.com/ZeusLN/zeus/pull/500)

Payout: 1,250,000 sats (0.0125 BTC)

Currently, ZEUS supports lnurl-fallback, lnurl-withdraw, and lnurl-pay but not lnurl-auth or lnurl-channel. lnurl-auth will allow users to log into lnurl-auth powered sites using their lightning node. LND doesn't support it natively but it appears Breez has found a workaround - that may be a good starting point. You'll most likely have to leverage ZEUS' local database. Check out the spec [here](https://github.com/fiatjaf/lnurl-rfc/blob/master/lnurl-auth.md).

## Accessibility fixes
Author: [sha-256](https://github.com/sha-265)

[Pull Request](https://github.com/ZeusLN/zeus/pull/1590)

Payout: 1,000,000 sats (0.01 BTC)

The fine folks over at the Bitcoin Design Community have detailed [an issue](https://github.com/ZeusLN/zeus/issues/1442) with our accessibility problems in ZEUS.

## Core Lightning: CLNRest API
Author: [niteshbalusu11](https://github.com/niteshbalusu11)

[Pull Request](https://github.com/ZeusLN/zeus/pull/2228)

Payout: 5,250,000 sats (0.0525 BTC)

Currently, ZEUS supports remote connections to Core Lightning (CLN) through c-lightning-REST, which will soon be deprecated. We'd like to replace this interface with the new [CLNRest API](https://docs.corelightning.org/docs/rest), a lightweight Python-based built-in Core Lightning plugin (from v23.08) that transforms RPC calls into a REST service - which is officially supported by the Core Lightning team. For the bounty to be accepted it needs to have full feature parity with the c-lightning-REST interface in ZEUS, including the ability to pay and generate BOLT 12 offers.
