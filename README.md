## Connecting ZEUS to your node

You can connect ZEUS to a remote Bitcoin Lightning node running [Lightning Network Daemon (lnd)](https://github.com/LightningNetwork/lnd), [eclair](https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair), or [Core Lightning](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning) using the [REST](https://github.com/Ride-The-Lightning/c-lightning-REST/) or [Sparko](https://github.com/fiatjaf/sparko) API.

You must provide ZEUS with your node's hostname, port number, and the macaroon you choose to use in **hex format**. If you need help converting your macaroon to hex format we wrote up a Node.js script that can use
[here](https://github.com/ZeusLN/lnd-hex-macaroon-generator/). Alternatively, if you're running a Unix-based operating system (eg. macOS, Linux) you can run `xxd -ps -u -c 1000 /path/to/admin.macaroon` to generate your macaroon in hex format.

### Tor Connection Guides

ZEUS has support for connecting to you node entirely over the Tor network. You can refer to these guides to set up a Tor hidden service on your lnd node. The instructions are generally interchangeable and typically only require you to change your Tor path.

## Starting development

**Don't trust, verify** the code with your own two eyes. Then when ready proceed to the steps below based on your platform.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (minimum version: 18.18)

### Android
1. install and setup react-native and its related dependencies under **"Building Projects with Native Code"** on
[react-native's Getting Started page](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
2. if using your phone,
[enable Developer mode and USB Debugging](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options)
, then make sure it is connected to your computer by running `adb devices`
3. install node dependencies with `yarn`
4. open up your Android simulator or connect your phone and run `npx react-native start`
5. open a new tab and run `npx react-native run-android`

### iOS
1. install and setup react-native and its related dependencies under **"Building Projects with Native Code"** on
[react-native's Getting Started page](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
2. install node dependencies with `yarn`
3. `cd ios && pod install`
4. open `ios/zeus.xcworkspace` in Xcode and hit Run.

## Contributing

Please be sure to run `yarn run tsc` to check for type errors, `yarn run test` to run all tests, and `yarn run prettier` to run the prettier

If you are making cosmetic changes please test on both Android and iOS as things don't render exactly the same on both platforms.

If you're looking for a quick way to get a lightning development environment running, check out [Polar](https://github.com/jamaljsr/polar).

NOTE: When configuring a new node on Android in dev, the `Host` field must be `10.0.2.2` - `127.0.0.1` or `localhost` won't work.

## Reproducible builds

Read our docs on reproducible builds [here](https://github.com/ZeusLN/zeus/blob/master/docs/ReproducibleBuilds.md).

## Translations

Do not directly modify the files in `/locales` unless you are adding new copy to the app in English. Instead, translators and reviewers should visit out [Transifex page](https://app.transifex.com/ZeusLN/zeus/) and request a role on the language you'd like to contribute to.
